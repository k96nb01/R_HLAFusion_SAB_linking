# R_HLAFusion_SAB_linking
Code for compiling single antigen bead (SAB) results from HLA Fusion tables. Single antigen bead (SAB) data in the HLA Fusion database is spread over several tables, and they need to be linked to compile usable results. This code starts with a list of samples from HistoTrac that had SAB testing, and links them to the Fusion tables to compile complete SAB results.

Version 2.0 is the initial version.
